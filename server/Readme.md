//npm i for the missing node_modules

by typing to the terminal "npm run start" the development server should start running on port 5000 or "http://localhost:5000/"

by typing to the terminal "npm run reset" a comfort function should start running that drops every data and table in the test.db and builds it up from the ground with default data.

as it was not established that this application should handle user authentication or authorization, i didnt add this as a feature, and i have not made a middleware that should handle a token based authenticaton.
